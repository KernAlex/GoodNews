# GoodNews

In works, the goal will be to take in a website address, and parse through objects and html tags to gather the story itself, as well as external sources. Using an NLP library, it will say if the story was good news or bad news by some metric. It should also have a mapping metric that maps words to number of times used in case one wishes to have these kinds of features to train a model on.
